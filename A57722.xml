         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS exceeding pleaſant to ſee how every one abounds in his own Senſe, according to the Dimentions of which is their Knowledge, it paſſing through the Senſes, as Pipes or Channels; whence their Judgements become generally praecipite, proceeding ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Analogie of things with themſelves, then univerſe, being grounded rather on the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their own Fanſies and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40644:4"/>Conceits, than on thoſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Whence that Saying of Phyſitians is verified, <hi>Non a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritia, ſed ab ornatu &amp; vulgi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus habemur excellentes.</hi> And that Monſter <hi>Opinion</hi> is become Supream Lord and Ruler of the World: It being come to that paſs, that, <hi>Ut Deus, ſic Medicus, ab omnibus, poſtremo cognoſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, etenim non niſi in extrema neceſſitate coluntur.</hi> They ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome are acquainted with the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, or GOD himſelf, till the last gaſp; any thing ſerves turn till then: Nay, even ſuch as make the greatest outward ſhew of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do in this particular, moſt groſly erre, and reſist the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of GOD, who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he hath ſent Phyſitians among them, they will, even to the loſs of their Lives, make uſe of Women,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40644:4"/>Illiterates, and intruding, bold, confident Empericks, who, if they perform any Cures, is but by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not being able to give a Reaſon for their Actions; and therefore, for the most part, must needs be miſtaken, ſince the ablest Phyſitians may be ſo, in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>But 'tis no wonder to me, that ſome perſons of quality, and in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters, wiſe men, ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make uſe of ignorant Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions &amp; Empericks, that can but brazen it out with them, ſith men are of late become as great admirers of Sthimaticks, and Enthuſiasts in Phyſick, as lately they were of the ſame in Divinity; as if Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Impudence were the only requiſite for a Phyſitian.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall add no more now, fince the ſubſequent Diſcourſe will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40644:5"/>ſufficiently evince the neceſſity of ſuch as are indeed worthily termed Phyſitians.

            <p>Although it be Calculated chiefly

                                 <hi>Boiſardus,</hi> and it is of a Gentleman of his familiar acquaintance, who being about two Months marryed to a fair and delicate Lady, was forc'd by reaſon of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by him committed, to fly into an other Countrey and leave her: where, in his exile and ſolitary thoughts, he was exceeding deſirous to know, if poſſible, what his Wife was doing in his abſence. Whereupon he conſulted a <hi>Magician,</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving where he then was; who firſt exactly deſcribed unto him the Frame, Building, and Ornaments of his Houſe where his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40644:49"/>Wife was, then her Shape, Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, Apparel, &amp;c. which being all true, cauſed as well as Admiration, a firm Belief of what he ſhould farther diſcover. Then the <hi>Magician</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him there was a very comely young man ſtanding cloſe unto her with his Breeches about his Heels; whence he poſitively concludes to himſelf, all was naught, and ſo reſolv'd to ſteal home privately, and kill her without mercy. At length coming near his own Houſe, ſent for her by a Ring ſhe had given him at his departure, and meeting, her courteous and loving entertainment, ſo allayed the heat of his Fury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, that he had the patience and the happineſs of ſome ſmall Diſcourſe. In which he inquired of her, if at ſuch a day ſhe had not on ſuch Apparel, and of ſuch a Colour; which ſhe (with much amazement) confeſſed; then he examined more cloſely, what that was which ſhe ſo ſmooth'd and ſtroak'd in her hand, and who that young man was that ſtood ſo near her with his Breeches about his Heels.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40644:54"/>and augment this, or that, or the other humour, and diſpoſe them to putrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and corruption at certain times, and in certain bodies, having in them ſuch impure humours,<note place="margin">The ſum of all applyed to the preſent Subject.</note> as are the Seeds of theſe <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</hi> Whence we ſee that in <hi>Autumn,</hi> and in the <hi>Spring</hi> men are moſt ſubject to the ingendring of them, the humours being by the ſeaſons diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, exagitated and expoſed more to corruption and putrifaction, then before; which ſeaſons (as you have heard) with <hi>Winters</hi> Cold, and <hi>Summers</hi> uncertain Heat (cauſed by the ſeveral Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Poſitions of the <hi>Starrs</hi> and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Configurations of the <hi>Planets</hi> as they are ingendred, or remitted) are likewiſe occaſioned. Whence in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by its Cold and Crude Air, many Crudities of the like nature are accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated in our bodies indiſpoſed; and in <hi>Summer</hi> by its ardent heat, in impure Conſtitutions, and ſuch as have an apti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for the ingendring of <hi>worms,</hi> are abundantly multiplyed.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40644:55"/>Heat, Cold, Drought, or Moiſture, or to any occult quality; For, we ſee often both <hi>Beaſts</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> nay and <hi>Men</hi> alſo, in great danger, by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Conſtitution alone, and malignant Influence; whilſt others in the ſame company and condition, are free, and all nothing; and that without the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of thoſe manifeſt qualities, the temperature of the Air, Rain, Hail, Snow, &amp;c. and perhaps too, without the mediation of any humours at all: which, if it ſhould be aſſerted: the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſometimes is ſo ſudden, ſo ſtrange and divers, it will be no eaſie matter to ſhew the contrary.

                        <p>I Shall begin with <hi>Congenite and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes,</hi> which are <hi>all the Ages of Man, from the Cradle to the Grave;</hi> which no one can avoyd that lives in the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40644:56"/>World, every one being in one or other of them; and if they live long, run through all. All which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Corruption, and apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender thick, groſs, viſcid, and putrid faeculent humours and Crudities of all ſorts and kinds, as in ſome meaſure hath<note n="d" place="margin">Cap. 5. Sect. 1.</note> been hinted.</p>
                        <p>As we ſee <hi>Infancy</hi> is but (as it were) a maſs of corruption and putrifaction, and (in a manner) made up of nothing elſe according to that of <hi>Job,</hi>
                           <note n="e" place="margin">Job. 17.14.</note> 
                           <hi>I have ſaid to Corruption, thou art my Father, to the Worm, thou art my Mother,</hi> whence they oftentimes are born into the world with them, as was<note n="f" place="margin">Chap. 5. Sect. 1. Subſect. 1.</note> ſhewed.</p>
                        <p>And after they are born, how long do they live upon Milk and ſuch a Diet as is moſt prone to corrupt and ingender them, to overthrow the tender frame of their Conſtitutions, to ſubvert the Courſe of Nature, hinder Digeſtion, improve Natural Heat, and introduce infinite ſorts of Crudities, the Seeds not only of theſe <hi>Vermine,</hi> but of moſt, if not all Diſeaſes.</p>
                        <p>And when they are able to run about, the caſe is the ſame with them for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Diet, or worſe; meeting them more frequently with variety of Traſh,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40644:57"/>and that which is worſt of all, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon a full Stomach, and at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable times; being tied to no order, nor having reaſon to regulate themſelves better.</p>
                        <p>Again, after the fourteenth year of their Age to the twenty fifth, who but they? And how many hundred thouſand, wayes do they in their youth, by their head-ſtrong courſes, inordinate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, extravagant gormandizing, ſitting up late at nights, whoring and other prodigal wayes, ſubvert their healths, extinguiſh natural heat, corrupt their blood and humours; and (thinking their own Wit beſt) run into all manner of Riot and Exceſs, hating reproof and admonition like <hi>Salomons</hi> Brute. g Theſe Diſorders hinder Natures operations, whence enſue Crudities, ingendring <hi>worms.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſame may be ſaid of the Fifth and Sixth Ages, ſince not one <hi>man</hi> or <hi>woman</hi> of ten thouſand, either know how to order their lives, to chuſe what is advantagious, and avoid what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive or noxious; nay ſome that do know it (ſuch are mens ſenſual appetites naturally!) rather deſtroy their Healths and Lives, then diſpleaſe their Palates;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40644:57"/>corrupt all the humours in their bodies, then croſs one fantaſtical deſire, or leave off one luxurious cuſtom, though never ſo deſtructive. They are no <hi>Changelings</hi> (they ſay) indeed: for their obſtinacy, and perſeverance in evil, it's true, they are none; it were well, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, if they were: yet while they boaſt of this, they cannot acquit themſelves of being <hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>Changelings</hi> in that ſenſe.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40644:74"/>before they are ſenſible, fall from their bodies. <hi>Haldromot</hi> in like manner, tells us of a wind that kills people on which it blows. And that in the time of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> many died by paſſing between two Mountains, by a mineral Air ſtufft with vitious and ſulphurious Spirits: and ſuch are frequent in many Caves in <hi>Hungaria, Sweden,</hi> and even among our ſelves where there are Mines. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, we ſee the beſt and richeſt Soil, yields the worſt Air; and the moſt ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril Plats, Sandy dry grounds, afford the moſt wholſome Air. So on the Hilly grounds, the Air is more cold and ſharp; in Vales and Bottoms, more thick, foggy and miſty, and many times fraught with very noiſome Vapours. Likewiſe wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Vales breed moſt groſs and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Air: as Rivers, Ponds, Moats, and marſhey grounds, make the Air more moiſt, thick and groſs. For although <hi>Cato</hi> commends the ſcituation of Houſes upon Rivers ſides, as alſo <hi>Columella</hi> near to a City, in rich grounds and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, it is rather for profit then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, wealth then health.

                     <p>THE various Cauſes of <hi>worms,</hi> are innumerable and intricate; for though we have aſſerted they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred in our Bodies of putrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, joyned with heat (which is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Putrifaction) yet it is not ſo apparent how that Putrifaction, or putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying heat, doth produce ſuch Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or how they aſſume their form. For, we are not to conceit this proceeds meerly from putrifactions, and concoction meeting therewith, or heat acting on the putrid humours; ſince neither of theſe can of themſelves bring forth a more noble thing then themſelves; but,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40644:75"/>as is moſt rational, to attribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the nature of the matter or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour it ſelf, in which the ſeed of the production is, or ſomewhat equivalent thereunto, having the proximate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and peculiar power of receiving ſuch a form included and latent in it ſelf. Whence it is, according to the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter and humour, this, or the other, or that kind of <hi>worm</hi> is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it is therefore requiſite we conſider <hi>Diet, Meat and Drink,</hi> whence thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours themſelves are ingendred.</p>

                        <p>HE that ſhall conſider it, will find our Food to have much more power to alter our humours, if it offend either in Quantity or Quality, then the Air, nay, and change our Conſtitutions; it having a marvellous efficacy in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Diſeaſes, yielding the very matter and ſeeds of them.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40644:76"/>of the Humours do concurr. So that I may ſay, <hi>this Diet</hi> is the Mother of all Diſeaſes, let the Father be what it will: wherefore it is moſt requiſite, we have an eſpecial care how we uſe or abuſe it, there being nothing in which we more frequently err, being for the moſt part guided rather by our ſenſual Appetites, then Reaſon, verifying that old true ſaying, <hi>Plures Corpula, quam gladius.</hi> For of theſe two, I may juſtly ſay, as the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> The <hi>Sword</hi> hath ſlain it's Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; but the <hi>Board,</hi> thoſe devouring Guts of ours their ten thouſands: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the right knowledge of this Diate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick part of Phyſick is not only moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, but moſt neceſſary.</p>

And therefore, that it is a main and principal Cauſe of <hi>worms,</hi> none will deny, and that in the beſt, and moſt unlikely bodies that feed much on it; eſpecially in ſuch as are any wiſe diſtempered, weak and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, have cold Stomachs, which makes it acide, or very hot, turning into Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, aduſt, and many obſtructions by it's coagulating.

                        <p>EVery particular almoſt, that I ſaid concerning the unſeaſonableneſs of Eating, may be averted, and is verified in Drinking: For if the Drink be never ſo wholſome and good, and taken but moderately; yet, if at unfitting times, cauſeth no ſmall number of, nor petty Diſeaſes; beſides, it is ſo far from quenching of thirſt, that contrariwiſe, it augmenteth thirſt. Now Drink may be unſeaſonably taken ſeveral wayes; as firſt, <hi>in a morning faſting,</hi> which our Drunkards and good-fellows (or rather lewd-fellows) call a mornings-draught, eating nothing at all therewith: for the ſinews are thereby hurt, the Head and Brain, and many Crudities accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the whole man rendred heavy and dull, and the ſtronger the Drink or Wine, the worſe. Secondly, <hi>between Meals,</hi> when thirſt compelleth not, not nature requireth it, eſpecially, before the meat be throughly concocted; for throwing on freſh Drinks frequently, and in great quantities, muſt needs, not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40644:127"/>only keep the mouth of the Stomach Hiant, but impead the Concoction of the Stomach, which is then about it's office; even as we ſee a ſpoonfull of water thrown into a great pot boiling, ſhall hinder and ſtop it; whence ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Crudities and moſt Diſeaſes, as well as <hi>worms.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>immediately upon Bathing, Sweating,</hi> or any other hard or violent exerciſe, which warms the Blood, ſtirrs the Humours, and opens the Pores; eſpecially Water or ſmall Drink, which ſerve rather to expell and extinguiſh natural heat, when ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Canary, and ſuch comfortable Drinks, are then to corroborate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, comfort and ſtrengthen the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and gently awake the ambient and expelled heat from the remote, to the internal parts. And laſtly, <hi>Drinking Bedwards, and late at night,</hi> is alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pernitious, ingendring many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtions, Diſtillations, Catarrhs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, and many feral evils, beſides <hi>worms.</hi>

The <hi>Indians</hi> make a Drink called <hi>Chica,</hi> which is compoſed of Water, Moloſſes, and ſometimes Honey, ſome Roots in thoſe parts, and the Leaves of Tobacco, with the largeſt Toad they can get, which they cloſe up altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a large Jar, cloſe ſtopt for three weeks or a months time, and that is their moſt delicious Drink for their choiſeſt friends; and it agrees as well with them, as Canary with us, through their conſtant cuſtome; when notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the very ſmell of the Jar, is of force ſufficient to ſtrike a ſtranger down, if not dead. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> for the moſt part, drink no other Water, then what is very impure, muddy, and ſlymie, as <hi>Galen</hi>

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40644:128"/>along great Towns and Cities; and yet moſt of the Beer and Ale in this Metropolis of <hi>England, London;</hi> is made of the water of the River of <hi>Thames</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by it, and receiving all its impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and yet is ſo far from altring of us that are accuſtomed to thoſe Drinks, that we accompt them the beſt of that ſort the Nation affords. And Water running through Leaden Pipes, though very noxious; yet in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as alſo here in <hi>England,</hi> we find no City prejudic'd by them, through their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe. <hi>Cyder</hi> and <hi>Perry,</hi> although for the moſt part bad Drinks, windy, griping the Bowels, ſtreightening the Breſt, hurting the Stomach, Head and Brain, Sinews, is crude, &amp;c. yet it is almoſt their only Drink in <hi>Guipuſcoa</hi> in <hi>Spain; Normandy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and in many parts in <hi>England,</hi> as in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire, Hereford-ſhire, Glouceſter-ſhire, Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall.</hi> And I know a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, that never drank any thing but <hi>Cyder,</hi> and yet is in perfect health and ſtrength.</p>
                        <p>And for the <hi>Quantity</hi> of Drinking, we frequently ſee, men make as it were, Barrels of their Bellies; for each man to devour a Gallon is nothing, three
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40644:128"/>Pints of Canary one after another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpit, in a health to a Miſtris, is a ſmall ſoop among our <hi>Hectors, Cutters,</hi> and <hi>Taring Ladds,</hi> the weakeſt of them can do as much, and never flinch for the matter, or be diſturbed, otherwiſe then what they are naturally, which is enough you'l ſay, or they would never be ſo mad.</p>
                        <p>And ſo for <hi>Time,</hi> they matter it not; no time comes amiſs to them, morning, evening, at noon day, and at midnight, nay, and all the hours both of day and night round too, without eating a bit in two or three dayes; nay, their cuſtome is ſuch, they are ſick if they do not thus continue; for they are no more of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> his breed, then thee or mee; and therefore would all ſoon be diſturbed, ſhould they live as temperately.

                        <hi>DIVISION</hi> IV. Retention and evacuation of Ordure a Cauſe.</head>
                     <p>YOU muſt know, <hi>Retention and Evacuation,</hi> is as notable a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cauſe, not only of <hi>worms,</hi> but alſo of many other Diſeaſes, as any whatſoever. For ſince for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reſtoring of our bodies and ſtrength, we have daily need of food, and ſince in the digeſting of that Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is ſeldome all converted into pure nouriſhment, of neceſſity there muſt remain a faeces, or an excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious uſeleſs part, the retention of which beyond the time requiſite, muſt cauſe Diſeaſes, and eſpecially this. <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely and intemperate evacuations,</hi> on the other ſide are worſe; for thereby the profitable nouriſhments are therewith ejected, and the whole body rendred thus debil and conſumptive, it muſt needs be, that <hi>worms</hi> muſt follow, as well as ſeveral other direful diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Now as there are divers concoctions in the body; as in the <hi>Stomach, Liver, Heart, Brain,</hi> and other <hi>Members;</hi> ſo are there divers excrements therein ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40644:132"/>whence there follows divers <hi>evacuations and retentions:</hi> Of which, ſome are <hi>ſimply neceſſary,</hi> as <hi>faeces of the bowels,</hi> and <hi>Urin;</hi> others not ſo ſimply neceſſary, but at ſome times: As <hi>Choler, Melancholy, Flegm, Menſtrues, Hemroids, Bleeding, Purging, Bathing, Wind, Sweat, fuliginous Fumes</hi> or <hi>Atom-like Effluviums, Teers, Scurf on the Skin, Snot, Spittle, Sperm</hi> (if it may be properly termed an <note n="†" place="margin">Exploded in my book of the Soul, <hi>an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traduce.</hi>
                        </note> excrement) all which, being ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, moderately, and in a due meaſure evacuated, conduce much to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of life and health; but if not, cauſe many incurable Diſeaſes, like unto themſelves; as is vulgarly known, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>worms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall give therefore a hint to the chiefeſt of them, and omit the reſt; for <hi>worms</hi> are not only ingendred by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-long <hi>retention of the Ordure,</hi> cauſing a ſlagnation and putrifaction of the excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c. but alſo the Head is eſpecially therby affected with Inflamations, pains, dulneſs, &amp;c. It moleſts alſo the other parts, ingenders wind, pains of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, hinders concoction by putrid va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, whence alſo <hi>worms,</hi> and many other evils; as it fills the veins, and obſtructs the paſſages of the body, a chief cauſe
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40644:132"/>of the Apoplexie, an enemy to Nature, and occaſioner of ſudden Death. <hi>Too frequent evacuation</hi> you have heard, is little better; for the Intralls are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby preſt, grypt, and forc't beyond their due; but alſo extreamly weakned, and all evacuation before a due conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whether of it ſelf, or by Phyſick, is very pernitious; for they are ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and all ſuperfluous evacuations, <hi>ſecundum plurimum,</hi> ingender putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and <hi>worms.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Retention alſo of Urin,</hi> is no leſs a cauſe, but of many other Infirmities alſo, and death it ſelf, ſo extending the Bladder &amp; Uritary paſſages with the neighbouring parts, that it cannot ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it ſelf; and thus in four dayes time, I remember this preſent Earl of <hi>Lauther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale's Father</hi> died about the end of 1644. or beginning of 1645. It cauſeth alſo the Strangury, Iſchury, Dyſurie, and many other Maladies, according to the nature of the retention; for if the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humidity be not by the Reins drawn thereunto, it remains mixt with the blood, where corrupting, cauſeth <hi>worms,</hi> and being an excrement of the Liver, and by this ſuppreſſion, diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into all the parts of the body, there
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40644:133"/>follows alſo Cachexia, Hydropical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the like. <hi>Exceſſive eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations of Urin,</hi> doth likwiſe cauſe grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Maladies; for thereby the moiſt parts of the body are conſumed, and in time the more ſolid; for it weakens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and occaſions not only <hi>worms,</hi> but alſo Conſumptions, Diabetes, and waſtes both body and mind, nay, and the very brain it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40644:133"/>with, but of divers other evils; as him in <hi>Lucitanus,</hi>

Bathing alſo on a full ſtomach, or before there be due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, diſperſes the humors, crude into all the parts, and is no leſs a cauſe. <hi>Cold Baths</hi> are worſe, eſpecially for ſuch as are growing, young people, or ſuch as are declining, and infirm bodies, or ſuch as feed groſly, for the Pores being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by conſtipated, the fuliginous malignant vapours being hindred from tranſpiring,

                     <p>Neither is there any thing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our bodies; for it weakens the body, extinguiſheth natural heat, hinders concoction and evacuation, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth obſtructions, fills the body full of flegm and many groſs, corrupt, excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious humours, whence theſe <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> are abundantly ingendred: Nay, it is the proximate cauſe of all manner of Infirmities.

Much exerciſe and wearineſs conſumes the Spirits and ſubſtantial parts of the body, and ſuch humours which nature would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe concocted, it irritates, and being ſo irritated, diverſly affect both the body and mind, tundring concoction, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times breaks the veſſels, and frequently it extravaſateth the blood, and cauſeth inflammations in the external parts and skin, invironing the Ribs, whence come<note n="*" place="margin">The peccant matter being conveyed by the aſcending branches of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi> which diſperſe themſelves into the four upper Ribs, or elſe the <hi>Azygos</hi> or <hi>vena ſine pari,</hi> whoſe circles are diſpoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other lower, whereby the <hi>Plara</hi> or membrane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting the Ribs, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.</note> Pluriſies; and if the Blood being thus violently irritated remain ſtill in the veins, it excites putrid Feavers. Likewiſe if the body be replete with vitious and corrupt humours, many evils eſpecially follow on violent exerciſe, for thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excited, and being diſperſed through the ſeveral parts of the Body, the Brain is filled with many fuliginous vapours, and in ſome weak parts, whereof they cannot ſo well dilate, they corrupt and

                           <p>Theſe, by their various amalgama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations one with another, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other wayes beſides, may not only ſubvert our good Temperatures and Conſtitutions, and prepare them, but alſo ſubjugate them to the Helmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick matter, and moſt, if not all other Diſeaſes.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Synedruous Aſſidentia,</hi> are <hi>ſociable Signs;</hi> yet ſuch as do not neceſſarily cohear to the eſſence of a Diſeaſe, neither are they inſeparable from a Diſeaſe, nor always preſent; but ſometimes (beſides the <hi>Pathognomonicks</hi>) they appear preſently at the beginning of a Diſeaſe, ſometimes they follow afterwards, and ſometimes again, they appear not at all, at any time of the Diſeaſe; and therefore, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare not the Diſeaſe it ſelf, or it's kinds; but ſome Condition thereof only.</p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:40644:158"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> and his followers comprehend <hi>Epiginomena's</hi> under <hi>Synedruous;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Fuchſius</hi> and others, mention only <hi>Synedruous,</hi> confounding the other there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. And <hi>Fernelius</hi> ſpeaks not a word of <hi>Epiginomena's;</hi> yet they are different Signs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epiginomena's</hi> and <hi>Epiphanomena's,</hi> are ſuch Signs as neither ſhew the kind of a Diſeaſe, nor the quality thereof; but only it's mutation. And they are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, as 1. Some are ſigns of Crudities and Indigeſtions. 2. Others denote Life and Death. And laſtly, others indicate the <hi>Criſis,</hi> and are Critical, preſaging the termination of a Diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>So that, although there are many and divers <hi>Fountains of Signs;</hi> yet may they all be reduced to theſe three following, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt to the eſſence of the thing it ſelf, whether it be <hi>a Diſeaſe, a Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>a Symptome;</hi> to wit, when a thing is ſo manifeſt in it's own nature, &amp; obvious to the Senſes, that there needs no other ſigns to make it more apparent. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. from the effects, or all things that follow health, a diſeaſe, and cauſes of a diſeaſe, Accidents, and Symptomes, whether the Actions are hurt, or the Excrements, Retentions, or Qualities. Thirdly, from
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40644:159"/>Cauſes which go before the Effect, whether they are <hi>external,</hi> as Air, Meat and Drink, Cuſtome, &amp;c. or <hi>internal,</hi> as Humours, Age, Temperament, Sex, &amp;c. by themſelves, or by accident, or what other way ſoever, &amp;c.

                     <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of the Diagnoſtick Signs of Worms.</head>
                  <p>ERE we can come to the Cures, it is moſt requiſite we conſider <hi>the ſigns of the Diſeaſe,</hi> that we be rightly informed of the nature thereof, or our Remedies will but be in vain; for the Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing latent in the body, we can never diſcover it without the ſigns.</p>
                  <p>And truly, it is no eaſie matter to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the ſigns of <hi>worms,</hi> or, at leaſt, by thoſe ſigns infallibly to conclude any one moleſted by them; ſince all the ſigns that diſcover them, are common ſignatures and indications alſo of other Diſeaſes. Neither do all the ſigns ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in all people, but in ſome more, in ſome leſs.</p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:40644:159"/>
                  <p>However, the ſigns of <hi>worms</hi> in the Inteſtines and latent there, <hi>viz.</hi> the moſt common and frequent are, ſqual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidneſs of face, and ſometimes by fits, high coloured, then again, pale; hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the eyes, and yet ſometimes, a kind of ſhining about them; itching of the Noſe, an unuſual defluxion of Spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a ſtinking Breath, mixt ſometimes with an acid reſpiration; a grating of the Teeth, eſpecially in the ſleep; an univerſal trembling over the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; unquiet ſleep, with frequent ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; an aſſiduous dry Cough; in ſome a continual loathing, and often vomitings, and ſometimes an inſatiable appetite; a Hickop, a drineſs of the Tongue and Lips, a pain and heavineſs in the Head, propenſion to ſleep; an extenſion and ſwelling of the Belly, ſo as that, being ſtruck, will ſound like a Drum; with many times a rumbling noiſe, through wind; in ſome again, the Belly is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred on the other extream, very lank; alſo looſeneſs of the Belly, in which their excrements are exceeding corrupt, and frequently reſembling Oxe or Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung; a gnawing and biting about the ſtomach, eſpecially faſting; frightfull and terrible Dreams and Fanſies in the
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:40644:160"/>ſleep; extream thirſt; if <hi>Teretes</hi> are at any time dejected, which occaſioning moſt grievous Symptoms, it is a ſign they are moſt abundant and peccant at that time; eſpecially if in a morning, whilſt the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is faſting, if any cold liquor be ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled upon his ſtomach, and find them run all together: Many times the body de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, and grows lean. If there be any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of <hi>cucurbitin morſels,</hi> the Patient is aſſuredly moleſted with your <hi>Lati Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brici.</hi> If there be an itching <hi>in Ano,</hi> it indicates <hi>Aſcarides</hi> offend. And ſo of others you may judge by the part af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Laſtly, the Pulſe is for the moſt part unequal.</p>
                  <p>It is no eaſie matter many times, to diſcover whether they be from a natural or magical cauſe, ſince as you have heard, the Devil oftentimes, and moſt times, works by natural means, and by the mediation of mens humours. Whence ſeveral able Phyſitians have been herein deceived; as may bee ſeen in their Writings. <hi>Sennertus</hi> tells us, he cured ſeveral that were ſorely affected with intolerable pains, and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the which he could not in the leaſt imagine proceeded from any ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, or magical Cauſe. Yet
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:40644:160"/>ſome Witches, then in priſon, were the Cauſes thereof, as upon their examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they confeſſed. For in that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravëd humours were by them excited, they were the cauſes of the enſuing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; in that they did it only by the mediation of humours, it was the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier diſcovered to be magical.</p>
                  <p>The chief <hi>Signs</hi> however, are theſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When the Patient is extraordinarily affected, and that, ſometimes, without the leaſt appearance of any natural cauſe whatſoever. Divers Inſtances to to this purpoſe, we have in<note n="†" place="margin">Daemona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latr. Sagar. <hi>lib.</hi> 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Remigius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. When the Patient ſpeaks an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Language he was never taught; deſcribes parties, habits, and actions at a diſtance, with whom he was never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When Phyſitians of known abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, are gravell'd and puzled about ordinary and known Diſtempers (which is commonly ſeen about <hi>worms</hi>) ſo as they know not neither what to determine, even within themſelves; alſo when all ordinary Infirmities, ſtoop not to proper and ſpecifical Remedies.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When Knives, Sciſſers, Pinns, Needls, Coles, Parchment, Pigions<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, lumps of Hair, or any thing elſe,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:40644:161"/>that cannot be naturally bred in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be evacuated by themſelves, ſtool, or iſſue out of any ſore or ulcer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When a diſeaſe ſuddenly changes, and runs into another without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent natural cauſe; or ſuddenly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes any in health, without any ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe; as that Youth mentioned by the afore-quoted Author, who being well, and only going to eaſe himſelf, ſuddenly gave a loud ſcreech, and then fell down as dead, and ſo continued in ſpight of all means, in ſo much as his Parents had thoughts of his Burial; but being by one, wiſer than the reſt by, perſwaded to deſiſt for three dayes at leaſt; the third day about the ſame hour he was taken, came to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but with ſuch intolerable and grievous pains, &amp;c. ſuch Concuſſions and Contorſions of his body, miſerably yelling, howling, and exclaiming for three dayes together, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; all that while neither eating nor drinking, nor taking any thing, but when they uſed ſtrong Ligatures againſt his Convulſions, which were fierce upon him, &amp;c. till at length he evacuated ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>worms</hi> of his own accord in bed, of the length of a mans middle finger, with
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:40644:161"/>black heads, and innumerable feet, &amp;c. He continued many years in this ſad condition; yet worſe at ſometimes than others of the Moon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If any thing be evacuated extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary or no, if it be not tangible, or vaniſhes in a ſhort time after.</p>

               <p>HAving thus briefly diſpatched the <hi>Symptomes,</hi> let us, in the next place, examine the <hi>Prognoſtick Signs of Worms,</hi> that we may the more plainly diſcover the danger of them; and ſo, conſequently, be induced to take the more care to avoid them.</p>
               <p>And for as much, as they are the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners and introducers of thoſe direful and hideous <hi>Symptoms</hi> before ſpoken of, and indeed of moſt, if not all Diſeaſes;

                  <hi>Teretes</hi> are worſe again, and occaſion moſt horrid Symptoms oftentimes; if they come from any body on a Criſis, it is a good ſign. But, if at the beginning of a Diſeaſe, it is bad, whether they be evacuated alive or dead; eſpecially if alone, without any mixture of excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if they be alive, it notes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Crudity, want of nouriſhment, and malignity in the Diſtemper; if dead, much putrifaction, which hath kill'd them, and is a bad ſign; arguing their expulſion to be rather from the Diſeaſe, than Nature: or if they come away of their own accord, it notes either the multitude of them, or that the Patient,

                  <p>AND thus I have given you in ſhort, the Indications and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Cure; to be as good as my word, I ſhall here add a cautionary word, how to prevent their generation in our bodies, as much as in us lies, that ſo thoſe direful Symptoms that follow on them, may never take hold in us. And ſince the <hi>ſix non-naturals</hi> are the main and moſt common Cauſes, I ſhall cloſe up this my Diſcourſe, with ſome ſhort Rules how to rectifie and mitigate their evil effects.</p>
                  <p>As it is eaſier to prevent a Diſeaſe, than to cure it; ſo it ought to be <hi>a good Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian's</hi> ſtudy, as well to preſerve Health where it is, as to reſtore it, where it is loſt. Much more ſhould it be the care of the <hi>Patient</hi> to take this wholſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice gratis; for he muſt needs know, it proceeds from a real deſire to do him good; ſince, if I ſought my own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, I ſhould in this particular be ſilent, wherein I ſhew men how they may keep themſelves in Health, without any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:40644:173"/>at all; (we ſeldom meeting with any that adviſe with us, how they may keep themſelves well; but how they may be cured when ſick) and that is, by <hi>Temperance,</hi> a Jewel of ineſtimable value, yet eaſily purchaſed; and cheaper than any one <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> this being the Iſſue of Vice, Diſorder and Intemperance.</p>
                  <p>Now, that I may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I ſhall in ſhort admoniſh you, that Health is nothing elſe, but a power of the due exerciſe of all the <hi>natural, vital,</hi> and <hi>animal actions</hi> of both <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> according to the courſe of Nature, conſiſting in a well tempered conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood and Spirits, and of all the ſimilar parts, as alſo a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable frame and Symetry, of all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganical parts, whereby there follows a juſt number of every one, a due magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, an exact ſcituation, paſſage and conſervation, with their continuity and union. But if in any of theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, there be a defect, it is no longer Health.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject matter of our Healths (you have heard) are theſe <hi>ſix non-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things,</hi> before ſpoken of; being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary to it's preſervation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f rightly uſed; and if abuſed, you ſee
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40644:174"/>how deſtructive: I ſhall therefore brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run them over; and ſhew how we may rightly uſe them to our beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and prolongation of our Lives, (and ſo conclude this Book) that is, extend them to their utmoſt poſſibility of ſubſiſting in this finite world, with the leaſt ſickneſs and inconveniency as may be.</p>
                  <p>I am not of opinion, that Health is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſerved by Meats and Drinks of the ſame temperature of the body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it; though, for the moſt part it be. For we ſee <hi>melancholy men</hi> would ſoon be deſtroyed, ſhould they eat ſuch melancholy meats, as have an Analogie with their Conſtitutions, by increaſing their evil habit of Body; and therefore ſuch Meats and Drinks as rather quail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, alter, and correct their cold and dry Conſtitutions, will be found much more convenient for ſuch.

Wherefore, as this ought rather to teach us to enure our ſelves to what is laudable and good, than evil: ſince it is ſo powerful in it's ſelf, and ſo difficult to be altred. So on he other ſide, we are not ſuddenly to break off a Cuſtom, though pernitious, leſt we run into worſe Inconveniencies, then that would have afforded us; for nothing is more deſtructive to mens bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, than ſudden alterations.

But if by eating we find our Wits hebita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, our Fancies and Reaſons obſcured, our Appetites ſatiated, our Bodies laſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated and ingraſſated, our Senſes nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, our Stomachs replete with acid &amp; flatulent eructations, and our Heads with Catarths, &amp;c. we may conclude we have exceeded in Quantity. Wherefore, in all our Banquetings and Feaſtings, let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that good Rule, <hi>To riſe with an Appetite;</hi> conſidering, <hi>we have two Gueſts to entertain, the Body and the Soul, and that therefore we have a care, that we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy not the powers of the one, nor the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the other.</hi> For though the Belly have no Ears, yet it hath Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to beg its due, and wiſdom to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern when it hath enough.</p>
                  <p>To point out a <hi>time</hi> alſo, for all Ages, Conſtitutions and Conditions of men, and limit them therewith, were more then a madneſs: Since Cuſtome alters much, and labouring men we know, can, and do eat often and heartily; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren alſo, being growing, are frequent eaters, and ſo require a conſtant ſupply of Aliment; when ſuch as are at matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40644:178"/>that lead a ſolitary or ſedentary life, are weak and infirm, can eat but at their accuſtomary times, and that but once or twice in four and twenty hours. The beſt Guide in this particular, is <hi>Hunger, eat not therefore, till ye have an appetite,</hi> and then not till ye have none: For when appetite excites not, it moſt part argues, nature hath not fully dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the former meat, or overcome the former diſorder; therefore at ſuch times, if we eat at all, it ought to be very ſparingly. This Rule accurately obſerved, would not only conduce to the avoiding of <hi>worms,</hi> but of indeed moſt, if not all Diſeaſes; keep the Bowels clean, and preſerve Health bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by far, than Phyſick. We muſt herein alſo, obſerve our Cuſtomes; for faſting too long on the other ſide, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly pernitious, as was ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. So that eating of Break-faſts, and Dinners preſently after, muſt needs be as bad; ſince the former cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, before the later be mixed with it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame may be ſaid of<note n="†" place="margin">Yet note that Claret, of all other Wine, moſt reſiſts theſe <hi>vermin;</hi> beſides I may, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it the harmleſſeſt French wine that is.</note>

                  <p>There ought alſo, to be a <hi>Right Order</hi> obſerved in eating and drinking, if we will avoid theſe <hi>vermin,</hi> and many other Diſeaſes; to feed on a ſimple Diet (as was ſaid) is beſt, but if that cannot be obſerved, let what is lighteſt of dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, or empeptick be firſt eaten, that they may ſerve to open the bowels, and not laſt, to corrupt all the Aliment, as we fooliſhly uſe to eat in Summer time, Cherries, Plumbs, and other moiſt fruits after Dinner.

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And firſt, as my former method was, of <hi>Anger,</hi> it is an excellent thing (to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this mad Paſſion) to get <hi>Meekneſs, Patience</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> for you ſhall ſeldome ſee Anger in any but proud people, it being indeed, the effect of Pride. Let's alſo examin our ſelves, why we are ſo, on what ground, what is the cauſe, or what occaſion, and then, whether it be juſt or no. <hi>Meekneſs</hi> is a calmneſs and quietneſs of Spirit, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to <hi>Anger;</hi> and may be exerciſed towards GOD, or towards our <hi>Neighbour.</hi> As for that towards GOD, I ſhall ſay nothing, ſince I think the vileſt of men dare not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him. <hi>That towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> is chiefly to be ſpoken of; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let us labour by all means, to get meekneſs, which is the ſobriety of the mind, and that which makes us both bleſſed here, and hereafter; for indeed, <hi>none but the meek injoy this world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.5.</note> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſuch as are prone to Anger, are like crazed and ſick people, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy the greateſt proſperities; for let all go never ſo well without, they ſpoil all by creating ſtorms and tempeſts
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:40644:182"/>within themſelves. Whereas by meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we conquer our ſelves, like this unruly Son of <hi>Zervias,</hi> behave our ſelves like men, and gain the love of all we converſe with; nay, it is that which makes us<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 11.29.</note> like Chriſt himſelf. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as <hi>Anger</hi> unmans a man; ſo <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> advances a mans honour.</p>
                  <p>This virtue, I ſay, we owe to out Neighbours, and all we converſe with, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as may bridle that mad <hi>Anger,</hi> being both miſchievous to them and our ſelves, being eſpecially thereunto<note n="†" place="margin">1 Theſ. 5.14, 15. 2 Tim. 2.25.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, whatever provocations we meet with; eſpecially being that, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf (who came to plant peace in the world among men) injoins us.

For their Anger doth not end uſually in reproaches and opprobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous words, but breaks for the moſt part, into Curſes alſo; and ſometimes, without any cauſe at all; contrary to the Rule given us.<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 5.44.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> will work much the ſame on us, if we rightly conſider them in oppoſition to <hi>Anger,</hi> it being an effect of Pride.</p>
                  <p>And truly, if we may ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reaſon, and morally, our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are indeed <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, ſubject to our own command. And therefore, one chief work of a man, that is really ſo, ought to be, to ſubdue them. And although, through Cuſtome, this with other vices, may be habitual to us, and uſurp over Reaſon, over-ruling it, &amp;c. yet is it not to be aſcribed to its nature, or theirs; but to our own neglect and indulgence to it or them, by GOD'S juſt Judgement, for our giving way to them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, in a moral and prudent way, let us reſiſt the firſt aſſaults, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Anger; if an Aſs kick me, let me not be ſuch a fool, as to kick him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for Reaſon hath no place, if Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion be once kindled, and then Rage will
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:40644:183"/>be too ſtrong to be curb'd. 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Anger in it ſelf, what a madneſs it is, how it deveſts a man of Reaſon; I, and Detunakes him too, and leaves him naked, for every Coxcomb to laugh at, rendring him rather the Son of <hi>Cerberus,</hi> then <hi>Moſes.</hi> 3. Let us leave it with the greateſt Celerity that may be, leſt the cuſtome of this Devil-like-ſin, take away the ſenſe of it. 4. Let us never ſhew our Teeth when we cannot bite, and never to be angry, therefore with ſuch as we cannot overſway and win by it; for to begin ſtrife, is more eaſie, then to oppoſe it; never let us therefore contend, either with equals or ſtrangers; nor with friends neither, but in a friendly way, leſt we make them our enemies. 5. In all our Converſes, it were well alſo, if we conſidered, and duly weighed the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the party, and his intention and will who we ſuſpect to give the offence, or occaſion of Anger, for if a Child, it is beneath our notice; or from an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant perſon, whether man or woman, of any age or quality; for ſo, if we be angry, they have more cauſe to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with us for miſtaking of them: Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he is a Droll, let him alone in his conceited folly, and Droll on; it may be
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:40644:183"/>his words come not from him with any intention of reflection, reflect them not on thy ſelf, and make not ſuch a fool of thy ſelf, as to make him wiſe by thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; when it may be, he ſpake ſimply, if not, look upon him as a ſimple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. If it be a Father, a Friend, or above us in quality, let us paſs it by for his former good works, or what we may expect from him; or let's do it on the account of Civility to oblige him. If a wiſe man, rather diſtruſt thy own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If he be a good man, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thou art at all injured. If a King, if thou art guilty, confeſs his Juſtice; if innocent, ſubmit to thy fates. If a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, never be angry, but perſwade or command him. If a Wife, convince her with mildneſs, or bear with her. If a ſcurrilous and wicked man, wonder not, much leſs be angry; for one or other will repay him in his own Coyn again; beſides, in ſo doing, he will bring miſchief on his own pate. If it be from GOD, we loſe as much time in being angry, as in praying againſt our enemies. 6. Upon all occaſions of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, ſeemingly offered, it were very well, if we would obſerve <hi>Octavian's</hi> Leſſon, to repeat the Letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet,

Or 7. It were to be wiſhed we could ſay, as<note n="f" place="margin">Architus Tarentinus.</note> one ſaid to his Bayliff, <hi>If I were not angry, I would beat thee.</hi> 8. That we would wean our ſelves from that arrogancy and ſelf-love that is in us, and eſteem leſs of our ſelves then we do; ſo ſhall we never find an injury to faſten on us, either ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly or wrongfully. For it is only the too great conceit we have of our ſelves, that makes us think none ſhould touch us; and upon the apprehenſion thereof, it being ſudden, we are preſently mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for every man naturally, hath an aſpiring mind, and is an opiniator, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Authority and Rule over all. 9. Curioſity muſt be avoided; for he that will have every thing neat, and to a punctilio, ſhall never have quietneſs, but be in continual wrath: Expect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from the beſt carriages of Friends, Servants, Children, as well as Enemies, miſcarriages, and let them paſs, <hi>huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt errare;</hi> for to commit ſuch a fault as Anger, upon a fault; and it may be, a trivial one, is as great a fault as can
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:40644:184"/>be committed, ſo that it is ſo far from amending the firſt fault, that thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him occaſion to chide thee. 10. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it is beneath thee, and baſeneſs to be angry with thy inferiour, or take exceptions at his words or actions, with thy Superiours, arrogancy, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly; with other Equals, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardus: we ſhould avoid diſpleaſure of all, could we but think ſeriouſly how advantagious ſuch an one, with whom we are angry, may be unto us here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; offences are better redeemed by merit, then requited with wrath; a ſoft anſwer turns away wrath, and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency and pardon, many times, ſo wins upon an Enemy, as he becomes a perfect good Friend ever after. 11. Let us requite good for evil, for ſo the quarrel ceaſeth, when Anger is but on one ſide, and he that is patient, ſhall be ſure to overcome. 12. Conſider, Anger is the worſt of vices, ſubjecting all other affections, nay, the ferventeſt love; for it hath been known, they have murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe, they have had moſt love for. Nay, what evil is it, that it will not plunge us in? And truly, if we conſider its inconveniencies and ruinous nature, nothing will make us, or help us more
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:40644:185"/>to avoid it. 13. Let ſuch as will ſhew themſelves truly magnanimous, reſolve that nothing ſhall move them, whatever befalls them; for if a wiſe man ſhould take notice of all the mad and fooliſh actions of moſt men, he ſhould never be quiet, and ſo it would render a man moſt unfortunate and miſerable that is wiſe, and fools would be more happy. He that is indeed wiſe, therefore hath nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls him, but what he expected. Laſtly, if thou canſt not chuſe, but be moved; let it not break forth, but ſtifle the fire in thy boſome.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

               <p>It's Diſpeſct into ten Heads, in which, though the Diſcourſe be chiefly ſuited to the Helmintick Meridian; yet the Ingenious and diligent Reader may
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40644:194"/>find the Analyſis of many Doubts, both in Phyſicks and Medicks in general, and that out of this Diſcourſe, the whole Art doth as it were Expullulate, as alſo caſt an uncorrugated Aſpect on the moſt Epidemical Diſeaſes now Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Inquinating humane bodies Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taptotically, and Metaſtatically. The Periphery of my Diſcourſe, ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be look'd on as the Extine Parts, which yet ſerve for compleating the whole.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Scorby not more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to our Bodies in this, then in former Ages.</note>And although there is a great Hue-and-Cry after the Scorby, moſt people being judged to be therewith affected now of late years, in which I confeſs, there is very much of truth; (as I have ſhewed all along in the Book) yet ſhould we examin the Aera of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, we ſhall find it an Endemial Malady to us in England, and all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine Places, and Northern Countreys; the very temperature of the Air in ſuch places, being ſufficient to diſpoſe our Blood, Humours and Ferments that Reſpire in it, to ſuch a Dyſcraſy; But why it ſhould now be Interpolated more then at other times, I know not; or why we muſt needs impute the Cauſe
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40644:194"/>of almoſt all Diſtempers thereunto, and their Cure to the Alleviation of the Scorby, wherein no man can be indeed, accounted healthy or wiſe, that is not Scorbutick Naturally. (according to my diſtinction of Natural Melancholy) Becauſe the Blood is more depurated and mundified by Scorbutick Ferments, than any other: Whence the Spirits, both Vital and Animal, become more denubilated, pure and ſublime.</p>

Even ſo would a DOCTOR, a Teacher of others, if he ſhould furniſh his Patients with Receipts and Medicines for their
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40644:195"/>Deſtruction only to pleaſe their Idle Fanſies.<note place="margin">Receipts, not ſufficient to make a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, or ſo much as a Practitioner.</note> For it is not the knowledge of Medicines, but the Adapting them <hi>pro Re nata</hi> that makes the Phyſitian; and how can any one then, ignorant in the <hi>Phiſiological part of Medicks</hi> be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhould he have all the Receipts in the world done into Engliſh, or verna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated: Let men be cautious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how they make uſe of Illiterates, Quacks, Mountebanks, and ſuch bold Intruders; much more how they adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on Receipts themſelves.</p>
               <p>I have therefore only given you the Indications and Method of Cure in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; and (as I think becomes me) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd the judging of your preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſome DOCTOR, that can rationally adviſe; ſince it is impoſſible for any man, amids ſo many various Complications of Diſeaſes that daily occur, and where not two of twice two hundred, are taken in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in all Reſpects, and from the ſame Cauſe, to give an exact Rule of Cure in any Diſtemper whatſoever.</p>
               <p>For although impudent Intruders, and Quacks venture on all things raſhly, and at a diſtance, their Ignorance not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40644:195"/>able to detect the Danger; yet a ſober and rational Phyſitian, will do nothing till he hath ſeen his Patient, conſidered the Diſtemper, weighed every Circumſtance for Denudating and Expunging the Cauſe. For if the Body be Cacochymick, it muſt be by ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal means, reduced to an Euchymick Conſtitution, by refraining Stegnoticks and Stypticks, Pygnoticks, Emphrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, Dyſpepticks, Hologotrophicks, and the like. And uſing orderly and rationally <hi>Secundum Artem,</hi> and from the hand of one that is INDEED A DOCTOR, Learned and able to adviſe Analepticks, Araioticks, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticks, Leptynticks, Ecphracticks, Pepticks, Eupepticks, and Threpticks. And ſo if the Caſe be of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as in Aſtma's, Phthiſis, &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicks are to be adminiſtred; in ſome Cephalick Diſtempers Ptarmicks are admitted, in others rejected; in many Diſtempers of Women, Hemenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicks prove an abſolute Cure. When the Viſcera are Emphracted, Rupticks alone avail, or ſuch as may malax them. Thus I could inſtance almoſt in every Diſeaſe, to ſhew you that the Practice
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40644:196"/>of Phyſick is of more weight, then the major part of men illiterate do imagine, whilſt they raſhly adventure their lives with Empericks, and the like; only on the bare ridiculous boaſts of ſuch Intruding Quacks Experience; when the truth is, all rational men muſt needs know they can never have experience in any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Phyſick. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defines Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience thus,<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Something I muſt ſay alſo, touching the Scheme of ſome very ſtrange Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmical Helmintick Vermin,<note place="margin">How <hi>worms</hi> of ſtrange forms come to be in us.</note> which may ſeem to ſome incredible; but I ſhall only ſay thus much, it will not be ſtrange to any man, that ſuch deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, monſtrous productions ſhould be in us, who but conſidereth, that both by the Air, our Meats and Drinks, the Salts and Semenalties of ſeveral Inſects, may be infuſed and conveyed into us, and allegated with our Blood, (which (as I have ſaid at the Liminare of my
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:40644:196"/>Diſcourſe) although ſubjugated by the power of our Spirits, and incarſerated ſo, that they cannot for ſome time exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their own Operations, nor inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Denudate themſelves; yet upon the diſorders of our Bodies, or accoſting a Diſeaſe, they combat moſt furiouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Worms not more frequent, or of greater concernment now, then in former ages.</note>Neither would I be miſtaken, when I aſſert WORMS in any place of the Book to be Cauſes of other Feral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies, as if I held them only ſo now in our Age; and not formerly even in all Ages. Or that now they do more frequently ſhew themſelves in us, than in times paſt. Or that they do any way alter the Nature of Diſeaſes ſo, from what they ever were, as the Method of Cure ſet down by the Antients, is now to be accounted invallid. But, as they are of general concernment, we may not paſs them with that negligence we do thoſe in the Field or Dunghill. Sith (as you have heard) they may expullulate from any Chyme in the Body. Neither do I deny them to be oft-times an Effect and Symptome of divers Diſeaſes,<note place="margin">That they are Effects as well as Cauſes.</note> eſpecially Putrid Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Cachexia's, Conſumptions, &amp;c. as well as a Cauſe.</p>
               <pb n="370" facs="tcp:40644:197"/>
               <p>Touching Ferments, which I often hint at, though by Galleniſts too much ſlighted, as among the Spageriſts as much admired. Yet as I ſaid, if we were but well acquainted with every Chyme and Juice in our Bodies, how they are moſt of them replete with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurious and Saline parts, and that there are many Sulphurious Saits in us, as well as Acid of a ſtrange Nature, eſpecially in the Stomach (the part firſt affected almoſt in every Diſtemper) which doth ſtrangely, and by a peculiar property Chylefie the Aliment of what nature ſoever in a very ſhort time, ſuch is the Power of that Menſtruum (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent from the Spleen out of the Maſs of Blood by the Arteries, or from ſome other part) as all the fire in the world can never do. Even as Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſſolves Gold, and Aqua-fortis Iron, and almoſt all other Mettals, and yet will not fix upon Gold, more than Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury on a more porous Body. I ſay, if this be conſidered and weighed, and the Energy of Microcoſmical Salts, and that they may, and do work variouſly one on the other, we ſhall find them (the Blood and Urin abounding with
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40644:197"/>Sulphurious Salts) to have much more power in Cauſing Diſeaſes, than the firſt Qualities.</p>
               <p>Which notwithſtanding, whilſt they allay each other, make no diſturbance; but if they grow predominant, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the reſt, a ſtrange Ebulition and Fermentation is made, or rather a perturbed motion of the Menſtruums Corpuſcles, as we ſee in Feavers cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Efferveſcences in the Blood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fermentation at all; where by the way, we may obſerve, 'tis not Heat alone, is the chief Efficient of Digeſtion; for Fiſhes that have little or no Heat, do yet ſtrangely, by that Acid Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum in their Ventricles, depaſce their Aliment ſo, as to become Threptick. And it is alſo known that the Alcohol of Wine, being anatically allegated with Spirit of Urin, migrate immediately into a Stone, even as powder of Alabaſter, tyed up in a Rag, and thrown into a Baſon of Water. Juſt ſo do Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſmical Salts work ſtrange Effects in us, when they fall foul one on another. Whence alſo we may note, that the Stone is not only ingendred of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſtick Humour, as it were Torrified
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40644:198"/>and Pugnotified by the Heat of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Siccity of the Part affected, but rather by the petrifying qualitie, and the abundance of thoſe parts in the matter accoſting a fit Menſtruum.</p>
               <p>To which we may add, there are two ſorts of Ferments, as that worthy Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatione.</note> notes. The firſt is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully Energetical in all it's Particles, and vigorouſly active in all it's motions; ſo as that it may be indeed termed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, in that whatever it is Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, that admits of Fermentation, although never ſo dull and unactive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ſo agitates the Particles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as to carry all with it in its own Motions. The other conſiſts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of one certain kind, which will only ferment the Particles of the Body of another particular Nature, when they accoſt each other, and ſo is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reſpective; as we ſee Salt of Worm-wood with the Juice of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and Salt of Tartar with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Vitriol Ferment effectually, and ſo do all fluid Salts with fixed, as when Acide Liquors are poured on Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, Coral, Steel, &amp;c. or Spirit of Niter, on Butter of Antimony; for it
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:40644:198"/>is not any Sulphurious matter will he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitate the Acuity of ſharp Liquors, but a <hi>Salin;</hi> as we ſee in the Cure of the Gout, Scorby, Spleenitick, and Hypochondriack Affections, the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and Acrimony of the Blood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly check'd and Dulcified by Tartarous Medicines. So the ſimple Juice of Barberries or Lemons, will quickly diſſolve Coral and Pearl, and Vinager Coral and Lapis Cancrorum. And that Honourable perſon, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and judicious Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Nat. Phil. Part. 2. fol. 78.</note> tells us of a certain Menſtruum or Tincture drawn from Rye or Wheat-Bread, which will effectually extract a Tincture from Pretious Stones, Minerals,  which perhaps, a ſtronger of another Nature, will not do; as we ſee fluid Salts quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dilute, making not the leaſt Ebuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas the fixed and fluid Salts meeting, do moſt furiouſly. So the violent Emetick and Cathartick quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Antimony are deſtroyed by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining it only with Salt-Peter: And<note n="†" place="margin">Helmon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cap. 23.</note> Aſarums Emetick quality, is alſo taken away, and converted into a Diuretick, by only boyling a while in common wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; which boyling in wine will not
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40644:199"/>do. Divers other Inſtances I might give to Illucidate the divers wayes the Chymes and Humours in our Bodies may be Fermented by this, not that, or the other thing; but what hath been ſaid ſhall ſuffice.</p>
